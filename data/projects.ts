      "Chat Mal is a full-featured cross-platform messaging application supporting real-time text, voice, and video communication. The mobile client is built with Expo React Native, targeting both iOS and Android with modern modules for camera, audio, video, and notifications. Real-time messaging and call signaling are powered by Socket.IO, while WebRTC enables high-quality voice and video calls with features like call logs, push notifications, and native call UI integration via react-native-callkeep. The backend, developed with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose), manages authentication, messaging, media storage, and notifications. Redis is used for caching and session management, Joi for validation, and services like Cloudinary and Nodemailer handle media and email delivery. The system also integrates Expo Push Notifications for reliable cross-device alerts. Designed with scalability, modular architecture, and production-ready security best practices.",

It adjusts leverage via Binance Futures API, sizes orders from a USDT budget, and automatically places bracket risk management using take-profit-market and stop-market orders with a TP:SL ratio. The engine inspects existing positions and open orders to avoid duplicating TP/SL, converts timestamps to Asia/Yangon, and runs on a scheduler loop with robust logging and centralized helpers. Designed for clear separation of concerns and safe defaults, including token-gated namespaces for future Socket/alerts if extended.",
