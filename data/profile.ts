  bio: "I'm Bo Bo Aung (Boolean), a full-stack developer with 7+ years of experience building secure, scalable web and mobile applications. I specialize in backend development with Node.js, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, Redis, and Socket.IO for real-time systems, and frontends with React, Next.js, and Expo React Native (TypeScript). I've delivered production-ready solutions across WebRTC audio/video calling, push notifications, camera/media workflows, and offline-first patterns. My expertise includes e-commerce and payments (Stripe, PayPal), authentication/authorization, and Linux/server operations. I favor clean, modular architectures with Joi-first validation, robust testing, and CI/CD, while leveraging AI tooling to accelerate implementation, reviews, and learning. I focus on performance, scalability, and user experience to deliver seamless, real-time applications that are maintainable, observable, and ready to scale.",
